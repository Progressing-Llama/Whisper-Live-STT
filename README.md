# Whisper-Live-STT

OpenAI's whisper unfortunetly does not support live transcription. This repo is meant to fix that using a sliding window method.

Feel free to check the detailed article below on the explanations behind the sliding window method.

## Future Updates
- [ ] Create an installable package
- [ ] Create examples to create super class that can leverage custom models or custom audio streams.
- [ ] Fix the sentence builder algorithm, it deletes text when single words are cycled through.
- [ ] Add an iteractive gui
## Installation

```bash
pip install -U openai-whisper
pip install pyaudio
pip install librosa
pip install numpy
```

Whisper requires ffmpeg, therefore the additional installation is required. 
```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

Alternatively, you can copy the ffmpeg binary file to the working directory of your project.

## Usage/Examples

```python
from live_stt import LiveSTT

print("Initializing...")

stt = LiveSTT()

print("Running")

stt.reset_ticker()

while True:
    stt.process()

    print(stt.confirmed_text)
```
## FAQ

#### FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified

This error occurs when ffmpeg is not found in the environmental path or found in working directory. Check installation guide.
